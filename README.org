* Envvar

A Clojure library designed to make working with environment variables easier. It borrows ideas from [[https://github.com/weavejester/environ][environ]], but is friendlier for using non-checked-in user-specific ~.env~ files (similar to the [[https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv][Ruby dotenv gem]]), and allows simple dynamic augmentation of environment variable values. It does not support ~.lein-env~ integration.


** Usage

Envvar resolves variable sources in the following order (lower numbers have priority, so dynamic overrides have highest priority):

1. Dynamic overrides.
2. Anything in user-loaded Java properties files.
3. Values in the ~.env~ file in the project (a Java properties file).
4. Java system properties.
5. Environment variables.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(require '[envvar.core :as envvar :refer [env with-env]])

;; return all environment variables as a map:
@env

;; return the value of the PATH environment variable:
(:path @env)

;; augment the environment:
(with-env [:one "hello", :two "world"]
  ;; @env will now also contain dynamically-scoped bindings for :one and :two
)

;; load more properties into the environment
(envvar/load-file-variables! "/path/to/properties.file")

;; reset all loaded properties, including ones from the .env file
(envvar/reset-file-variables!)
